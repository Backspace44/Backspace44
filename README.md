I'm a young IT enthusiast currently studying at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bucharest. 

I am currently in my second year and I can say that the subjects I am studying, such as Fundamental Algorithms, Probability and Statistics, Operating Systems are areas of great interest to me, which is why I am determined to deepen them by accumulating work experience. 

I consider myself a determined, committed and responsible person. I treat any imposed task seriously and I can mobilize in the shortest possible time, which is due to the resilience of my character. 
As I can act both on my own and in a team, I have excelled in realizing and presenting numerous projects, among which I mention: the realization of a Spotify application with user-friendly graphical user interface, written in C++ object-oriented programming language; the simulation of the operation of deterministic, non-deterministic and deterministic finite automata implemented in programming languages such as Python and C++.

On the career goals side, I aim to excel in mastering fundamental and in-depth concepts of computer science theory, which I can then apply in various projects. I aim to add value to the company in which I will be working by actively contributing to the company's goals with the knowledge I demonstrate. 

Apart from my university-related activities, I am involved in my personal development, through various activities that broaden my perspective, mature and develop my creativity. 
Therefore, I consider myself to be a capable and competent person, always ready to make a contribution in what I do. I am always open to networking and collaboration opportunities. Let's have a chat!
